1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

True   False

2.What are the three Boolean operators?

and  or  not

3.Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

--------and --------------------------
True and True = True
False and False = False
True and False = False
False and True = False

--------or ---------------------------
True or True = True
False or False = False
True or False = True
False or True = True

--------not --------------------------
not True = False
not False = True

4.What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) = False
not (5 > 4) = False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) = True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) = False
(True and True) and (True == False) = False
(not False) or (not True) = True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

==
<
>
!=
!<
!>

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

assignment is = and assigns a value to a variable
equal to operator is == which compares one value to another

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

a condition is part of a statement (such as if, while, for) which evaluates to boolean True or False and determins if and how the statement runs

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
---------------------------------
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
--------------------------------------    
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input("Please type an integer: "))

if spam == 1:
     print("Hello")

elif spam == 2:
     print("Howdy")

else:
    print("Greetings")

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

ctrl c

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

Break will stop a statement being executed and break out of that code block
Continue will stop executing the code block at that point and go back to the beginning for the next item/loop

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

range(10) will evaluate from 0 implicitly to (but not including) 10 
range(0, 10) is the same as above but 0 stated explicitly
range(0, 10, 1) will give same result as above however explicitly states the step


13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
    
while spam < 11:
    print(spam)
    spam += 1


14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
